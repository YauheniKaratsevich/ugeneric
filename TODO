- implement dict resize (lazy resize, i.e. resize gradually)
- in case of collision in hash table append a new element to beginning of the chain
- improve Makefile
- improve print_trace() to show output similar to GDB (addr2line functionality)
- improve UT coverage and framework
- rename xxx_get_size to xxx_get_len, so len applies to any container
- implement deque http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6292332/what-really-is-a-deque-in-stl
- stack on top of vector, deque and list
- queue on top of deque or list or circullar buffer (current implementation)
- queue/dequeue iterators
- implement multiset (on BST)
- implement vector iterator
- improve MCHUNK functions (load/store from/to file)
- improve parse/serialize compatibilities with JSON spec
- implement vector vtable for different sort methods
- different types of assert (input check, logic erros, internal sanity checks) with option to disable them
- verify all getters/settes naming, should be in form xxx_{action}[_noun]
- mutating and const iterators for list/vector
- all ranges should be half open, i.e. [)
- bst destroying should not use recursion (Day-Stout-Warren)
- for bst without balancing implement Day–Stout–Warren algorithm to make it balanced
- deque shrink_to_size
- vector slice
- insert vector into vector
- dict compare (for all backends)
- hide RB tree color inside one of the links
- xxx_set_destroyer,xxx_set_comparator and xxx_set_copier should return the old handler for being able to restore it
- queue_is_full
- overwrite mode for queue
- implement missing methods for void* data management for all containers (only vector contains all as for now)
